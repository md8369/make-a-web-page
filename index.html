<h3>UNDERSTANDING THE INTERNET</h3>
<p>
The internet is a group of computers  sending and receiving messages. When a person types a web page it travels across the internet to servers. The servers look up the information requested and sends it back to the browser.
</p>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>Hypertext Markup Language is  the <em>heart</em> of the web. 
It contains text content that you can see and markup is how it looks.
</p>
<h3>TAGS</h3>
<p><em>HTML</em> documents are created using tags. Tags have an opening and a closing depending on which one you are using. Examples of tags are bold,emphasis, anchor and linkable tags to display images or website. 
</p>

<div class = "lesson 2"><h3>DEVELOPER TOOLS</h3></div>
<div>

<P>HTML are either inline or block. Block elements form an invisible box around the content.
<em>HTML</em>and <em>CSS</em> are both languages. HTML controls the structure of a webpage. CSS controls the style of a page.
When programmers talk about the <b>DOM</b> <em>(Document Object Model)</em> they are talking about the
tree-like structure of a page.
HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. CSS is the style sheet
language used for describing the look and format of document written in a markup language
.</P>

<h3>TREE-LIKE STRUCTURE</h3></div>
<div>

<P>The tree-like structure of HTML comes from the fact that 
<em>HTML</em>  elements and have other elements inside of
them. You can draw the relationship like a family tree. In a browser it shows up as a series of nested boxes.
When reading an <EM> HTML</EM> document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down
the left side of the document.

<h3>TEXT EDITORS FOR PROGRAMMERS</h3>

<p>When writing a code, programmers use special text editors like sublime text.
They make life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically adding closing tag.

  <h3>INHERITANCE</h3></div><p> Inheritance is the feature in CSS. It relies on
ancestor-descendant
relationship to operate. Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties
are applied not only to speicified elements but also its dscendants. Properties that can
be inherited are color,font,letter-spacing,line-height,list-style,text-align,text-indent,
text-tranform,visibility,whitespace and word spacing. Properties that cannot be
inherited are background,border, height,width ,outline,
padding, position and text decoration just to name a few.

<div>
  <p>Code comments are lines of text that the computer ignores. They are just notes the
  programmer can use for other people to see.</p>

<H3>CODE, TEST AND REFINE</H3>
<p>Everything on the web is a box structure design. There are 5 key points to remember: 1.Look for natural boxes 2.
Look for repeated styles and semantics 3. Write your HTML 4. Apply styles from biggest to smallest  5. Fix things</p>
